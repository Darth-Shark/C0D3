        <br>
        <p>I have always enjoyed coding, and was glad to build upon my previous HTML and JavaScript experience in this class. It was interesting seeing how some skills I've 
        learned in other programming languages where applicable to this class. HTML is fascinating because of you ability to run scripts of JavaScript inside the HTML code, 
        making it a union of two languages. This did occasionally result in some headaches when  things were different, such as commenting out code taking far more effort 
        in HTML than JS. In the end, I learned many useful skills, expanding my coding knowledge.</p>
        <p>The last unit of this class was oriented around a project which each student chose themself. The project I chose was a story told through the medium of a changing 
        webpage. This turned out to be more difficult than I had originally anticipated. I was able to create a framework for my story, some coding for text transitions 
        that I could copy and paste as needed, but this took time. I am not entirely satisfied with the final result, but I enjoyed the narrative I was writing.</p>
        <p>Tech has always been one of my favorite class topics. I always enjoy learning more about coding and the backend of things. I am grateful that I was able to learn 
        more about constructing websites. This course has been essential, as I plan to major in Computer Science. I hope to build upon the skills I have learned here in 
        the future.</p>

        <p>Nearly every single assignment in this class that was not itself coding was a discussion board, such as the one below.</p>
